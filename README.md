# LetsEat
LetsEat app is design for lonely BU students to dine out with other lonely BU students.<br>
We will match users based on their majors and preference to types of cuisine. Users will choose to match or unmatch other users (swipe left or right) just like tinder. <br>
Users are able to chat with others after they match and the app will suggest restaurants for them to dine. We are planning to use three apis for our app.<br>
