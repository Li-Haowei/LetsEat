# LetsEat
LetsEat app is design for lonely BU students to dine out with other lonely BU students.<br>
We will match users based on their majors, preference types of cuisine, prefer time to eat, and twitter . Users can choose to accept (swipe right) or dicline other users' dining invitations(swipe left or right) just like tinder. <br>
Users are able to chat with others after they match, to discuss the details of the dining experience. We are planning to use three apis for our app.<br>

# Note For Grader
1. Feel free to register your own accoun. The app does have email verification function, but you can choose to not verify your email, it will not affect your expereince except  
2. After registering an account, we encourage you to bind your twitter account in profile page, which will help the matching algorithm to work better
3. Once you swipe right or accept a dining experience, the app will automatically jump to the chat list activity and a chat channel between you and the person who made the invitation will be created
4. Please note that once you swipe right or accept and invite, that restaurant invitation will be permanently deleted from the database. We try to leave as much restuaurant invitation in the databse 
   as we can, but if you accept too many invitations, it is possible that you would delete all the invitations in the database and there will be no invitation to show on the main page. 
5. We purposefully hide our api keys, and we will include the file containing all the . Theoretically, you should be able to compile the code right out of the box,but if you encounter any problem while
   compiling, please send a email to us and we will try our best to help you.
6. Hope you enjoy the app.
